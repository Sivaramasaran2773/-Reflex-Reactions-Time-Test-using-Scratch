# Reflex-Reactions-Time-Test-using-Scratch
*This game is to test your reactions speeds. Where we are using our right click of our mouse
to react to the instruction displayed on our screen where there are two colours Red and Green
Flickering on the screen. The faster you react when the Green Screen is displayed the lower
your the Reaction Speed. If you React on the Red screen, you are out of the game. Here we
are playing this for three times in a row and the Average of those three reaction times is
calculated and gives the final score as Total reflex reaction Time.*
